project submissions regarding Bharat Internship
Project 1: Iris Flowers Classification
Overview :- Welcome to the repository for my Bharat internship Task 1! In this project, I implemented a machine learning model for Iris Flowers Classification. The goal was to predict different species of flowers based on the length of their petals and sepals. The entire project is coded in a Jupyter notebook.

Project Highlights :-  
    Techniques Used:-  Machine Learning, Iris Dataset, Jupyter Notebook
    Key Features:-
        -> Utilized machine learning algorithms to classify iris flowers.
        -> Focused on the length of petals and sepals for precise classification.
        -> Achieved high accuracy using advanced techniques.

Getting Started :- To explore the project, simply open the Jupyter notebook file: iris_classification.ipynb.
Acknowledgments :- I express my gratitude to the Bharat internship program for providing this learning opportunity.


Project 2: Wine Quality Prediction
Overview :- This section of the repository showcases my work on Task 2 of the Bharat internship – Wine Quality Prediction. The project involves building a machine learning model to predict the quality of wine using linear regression. The entire code is implemented in a Jupyter notebook.

Project Highlights :- 
    Techniques Used: Linear Regression, Wine Quality Dataset, Jupyter Notebook
    Key Features:-
        -> Implemented a linear regression model for predicting wine quality.
        -> Analyzed key features influencing wine quality.
        -> Developed insights into the nuances of wine quality prediction.

Getting Started :-  To explore the project, navigate to the Jupyter notebook file: wine_quality_prediction.ipynb.
Acknowledgments :- Special thanks to the Bharat internship program for providing a platform for hands-on learning.
